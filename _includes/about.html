                <p> Ricochet was launched in 2014 as a different approach to instant messaging that doesnâ€™t trust anyone in protecting your privacy.</p>
                <p>Ricochet Refresh uses the original Ricochet open-source software but has improved on it substantially, such as upgrading its security and making it compatible with Tor Onion Services v3 instead of the older v2.</p>
                <p> We believe software like Ricochet is important to protect freedom of expression for whistleblowers, activists, and journalists worldwide. </p>

                <p> Ricochet Refresh is a peer-to-peer messenger app that uses Tor to connect clients. 
                    When you start Ricochet Refresh it creates a Tor hidden service on your computer. 
                    The address of this hidden service is your anonymous identity on the Tor network 
                    and how others will be able to communicate with you</p>

                <p> To start a chat with someone you need to add the address of their Ricochet Refresh 
                    hidden service to your contacts. When you start a chat with one of your contacts a 
                    Tor circuit is created between your machine and the your contact's machine. A Tor 
                    circuit consists of a series of hops between your machine, Tor nodes, and your 
                    contacts machine. It is this use of multiple nodes that provides anonymity, no 
                    single node knows both the origin and destination.</p>
